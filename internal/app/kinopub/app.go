	// Optional: PauseRequests / ResumeRequests hold or release an individual
	// episode — including one that is actively downloading (its download is
	// canceled and its partial segments preserved). A paused episode is set aside
	// and skipped; the run stays alive while any episode is held, so it can be
	// resumed. nil disables per-episode pause.

	// (re-attempting it in place, without a new job). nil disables live retry.

	// Optional: CancelRequests drops an individual episode from this run entirely:
	// an in-flight download is stopped, a queued/parked/held one is removed from
	// the work queues. Unlike a pause the run does NOT stay alive for it — the
	// episode is tallied as failed ("canceled") and its siblings keep going. nil
	// disables per-episode cancel.
	CancelRequests <-chan domain.EpisodeKey

	// Optional: Paused reports whether the whole run is being paused (as opposed
	// to canceled). When it returns true on exit, partial segment data (.hls-tmp)
	// is preserved so a later resume continues instead of restarting. nil ⇒ never
	// paused (a context cancel is a hard stop that cleans up).
