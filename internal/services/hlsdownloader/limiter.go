// Why this is not a constant: the right number depends on the link, and the
// spread is enormous — on fast fibre a handful of connections leaves the pipe
// half empty (the CDN shapes per connection, and one TCP stream is limited by
// RTT and window size), while on a slow or lossy link that same number causes
// contention and timeouts. Any fixed value is wrong for most users.
//
// The controller runs one measurement window at a time: it records the bytes
// finished in the window, converts that to a rate, and compares it with the
// previous window. Better means the last step up helped, so it steps up again;
// worse means we overshot (or the link degraded), so it steps back and settles;
// roughly equal means we are at the knee of the curve, so it settles there. A
// settled limit is re-probed later, because the link does not hold still.
//
// A 429 or 503 short-circuits all of that: the server has told us we are over
// the line, so the limit is halved immediately and every worker is parked for
// the Retry-After the server asked for. That is the honest version of the fixed
// "min interval between requests" knob this replaces — it costs nothing when the
